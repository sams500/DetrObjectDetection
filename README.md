# DetrObjectDetection
The project has 2 notebooks:
- detr_simple_detection: it uses the facebook's DETR pretrained model with resnet-50 as its backbone. 
  The model detects objects on a single image loaded from the internet using its url or from a local folder. 

- panoptic_segementation: it uses the pretrained panoptic segementation model and detectron2 for displaying beautiful image results.
